/**
 `PublicRoomsDirectoryDataSource` is a base class to display public rooms directory.
 A `PublicRoomsDirectoryDataSource` instance provides rooms to displayed in a`PublicRoomsDirectoryViewController`.

 As a `MXKDataSource` child class, the class has a state where values have the following meanings:
     - MXKDataSourceStatePreparing: the data source is not yet ready or it is fetching data from the homeserver.
     - MXKDataSourceStateReady: the data source data is ready.
     - MXKDataSourceStateFailed: the data source failed to fetch data.
 
 There is no way in Matrix to be notified when there is a change in the public room directory.
 As a workaround, the data source refreshes its data when there are more than 10s old.
